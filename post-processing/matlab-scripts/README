These MATLAB scripts and functions will read lesgo's binary output data into MATLAB so that they can be post-processed.

USAGE:
- Copy all the MATLAB scripts/functions into the directory where your data is stored (this should be the same directory level where lesgo_param.out is located).
- The script will read lesgo_param.out to get the simulation parameters.
- The script assumes the other data (statistics, snapshots, etc.) are stored in ./output.

FEATURES:
As of 9 June 2016, the scripts can read all standard lesgo output files

TESTING:
Successfully testing on the following MATLAB versions:
- R2011b, R2013b, R2015b

CONTRIBUTING:
These MATLAB scripts are hosted within the lesgo project and at: https://github.com/jbret/binary-read-lesgo.git
Feel free to contribute changes at either location.
